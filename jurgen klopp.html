<p>On 8 October 2015, Klopp agreed a three-year deal to become Liverpool manager, replacing Brendan Rodgers. According to El País, Liverpool co-owner John W. Henry did not trust public opinion so he looked for a mathematical method very similar to Moneyball, the approach that Henry used for the Boston Red Sox in guiding them to three World Series wins, which he also owns via Fenway Sports Group.[86] The mathematical model turned out to be that of Cambridge physicist Ian Graham, which was used to select the manager, Klopp, and players essential for Liverpool to win the UEFA Champions League.[87] In his first press conference, Klopp described his new side saying "it is not a normal club, it is a special club. I had two very special clubs with Mainz and Dortmund. It is the perfect next step for me to be here and try and help" and stating his intention to deliver trophies within four years.[88][89] During his first conference, Klopp dubbed himself 'The Normal One' in a parody of José Mourinho's famous 'The Special One' statement in 2004.[90]





Having started the 2021–22 season with five wins and three draws from the first eight league fixtures, on 24 October 2021, Liverpool beat Manchester United 5–0 at Old Trafford.[185] This was Klopp’s 200th victory in 331 games in charge of Liverpool, making him the fastest manager in the club’s history to reach that milestone.[186] On 1 December, Klopp led Liverpool to a 4–1 away win against Everton in the Premier League as the club became the first team in English top-flight history to score at least two goals in 18 successive games in all competitions.[187] On 7 December, Liverpool won 2–1 away against A.C. Milan at the San Siro and became the first English club to win all six Champions League group games in the competition's history.[188] On 16 December, Klopp became the fastest manager in Liverpool history to record 150 league wins with a 3–1 home win against Newcastle United in what was Liverpool's 2000th top-flight win, the first club in English history to reach this landmark.[189] On 27 February 2022, he led Liverpool to its first domestic final since 2016, the 2022 EFL Cup Final where they defeated Thomas Tuchel's Chelsea 11-10 on penalties after a 0-0 draw that went to extra time.[190] It was a record-breaking 9th victory for Liverpool, and the first time they had won it since 2012.[191] Following Sean Dyche's dismissal by Burnley on 15 April, Klopp became the longest serving manager in the Premier League.[192] On 28 April 2022, Klopp signed a two-year contract extension, extending his stay at Liverpool until 2026.[193][194] In his announcement to the Liverpool supporters, he cited his wife Ulla, as one of the main reasons for signing the contract.[194]
