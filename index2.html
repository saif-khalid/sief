                <h2>REAL MADRID'S HISTORY</h2> 
                <p>Three years after its founding, ie in 1905, the team named "Madrid FC" was able to win the first official local championship, 
                    <br>after defeating Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Cup final .  The team managed to retain the championship title for four consecutive years
                    <br> (it was the only official championship held at that time).
                    <br>The club was one of the founding members of the Spanish Football Federation on January 4, 1909 , when the team was represented by its president, Adolfo Melendez ,
                    <br> to sign the agreement to establish the Spanish Federation.  In 1912, the team moved to its good stadium, 
                    <br>which is called "Campo de O'Donnell" after the team was moving from one place to another due to the lack of a private stadium.
                    <br>In 1920, the name of the team was changed to Real Madrid by King Alfonso XIII of Spain, who was given the title "Real", which means "royal" to the team.
