<p>2016–17 season

Mané playing for Liverpool in 2017
On 28 June 2016, Mané joined Liverpool for a transfer fee of £34 million on a five-year contract. The transfer fee made him the most expensive African player in history at the time.[44][45] On 14 August, he made his Premier League debut for the Reds, scoring the fourth goal in a 4–3 away win against Arsenal.[46] Having missed Liverpool's defeat at Burnley through a slight shoulder injury, Mané returned to the starting line-up against Burton Albion in the League Cup where he had two assists in a 5–0 win.[47]

On 19 December, Mané scored the only goal of the 227th Merseyside derby in added time against Everton at Goodison Park.[48] On 11 February 2017, Mané scored two goals within two minutes against Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield, for Liverpool's first league win in 2017.[49][50] On 20 April 2017, Mané was named in the PFA Team of the Year after scoring 13 league goals in his first season with Liverpool.[51] Despite missing the latter part of the campaign through injury, Mané was awarded the Liverpool Player of the Season award on 9 May 2017.[52]

2017–18 season
In the first match of the new season, on 12 August 2017, away to Watford, Mané scored Liverpool's first goal of the season in a 3–3 draw. He was named Premier League Player of the Month after scoring a goal in each of the Reds' three matches in August.[53] On 9 September 2017, he was given a straight red card in the first half of a 5–0 loss to Manchester City for a high boot against goalkeeper Ederson,[54] resulting in a three-match ban.[55] Mané, Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Philippe Coutinho made up a prolific attacking quartet dubbed the "Fab Four" and "Fab Three" after the mid-season exit of the latter.[56]

On 14 February 2018, Mané scored his first hat-trick for Liverpool in a 5–0 away win against Porto in the round of 16 first leg of the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League.[57] In doing so, he became only the second player to score an away hat-trick for the club in Europe.[58] Later, with a goal in the 3–0 win over AFC Bournemouth on 14 April, he overtook Demba Ba's record of 43 to become the highest scoring Senegalese in Premier League history.[59]

On 26 May, during the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final against Real Madrid, Mané scored Liverpool's equalising goal in a 3–1 defeat.[60] In doing so, he became the first Senegalese player to score in the final of the competition. His goal was also his 10th for the campaign which saw Liverpool become the first team in history to have three players score 10+ goals in a single Champions League season, with Mané achieving the milestone alongside fellow forwards Salah and Firmino.[61]

2018–19 season
On 22 November 2018, Mané signed new long-term deal with Liverpool.[62] On 10 March 2019, Mané scored twice in a 4–2 win over Burnley, the second of which was his 50th competitive goal for Liverpool.[63][64] His goals also saw him become only the fifth Liverpool player to score in six consecutive home Premier League appearances after Michael Owen, Fernando Torres, Luis Suárez and Salah.[65] Three days later, he scored twice more in a 3–1 win over Bayern Munich to help Liverpool progress to the quarter-finals of the Champions League. In doing so, he became the club's record goalscorer away from home in the competition with seven goals to his name.[66] During Liverpool's next match, he broke another of Ba's records to become the Senegalese player with the most goals scored in a single Premier League season, after scoring his 17th goal for the campaign in a 2–1 win over Fulham.[67] On 20 April, he was one of six players nominated for the PFA Players' Player of the Year award alongside teammate Virgil van Dijk.[68] He was also named in the PFA Team of the Year alongside Liverpool teammates, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Andrew Robertson and Van Dijk.[69]

On the final day of the domestic campaign, Mané scored twice in a 2–0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. His brace took him to 22 goals for the campaign which saw him share the Premier League Golden Boot award with Salah and Arsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.[70] On 1 June, Mané helped win an early penalty for Liverpool in the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final against Tottenham, only 24 seconds after the kick-off, after his cross was judged to have hit Moussa Sissoko's arm inside the penalty area; Salah subsequently converted from the spot to open the scoring, and Liverpool ultimately won the match 2–0 to claim the title.[71]

2019–20 season

Mané playing for Liverpool in the UEFA Champions League, December 2019
On 14 August 2019, Mané scored twice in the 2019 UEFA Super Cup final against Chelsea in a match that Liverpool won 5–4 on penalties after the game had finished 2–2 after 120 minutes.[72] Mané was named man of the match.[73] Exactly one month later, he scored twice in a 3–1 win over Newcastle United and extended his record run of matches without defeat for Liverpool at Anfield to 50 matches, a league record by any player at a particular stadium.[74] On his 100th Premier League appearance for Liverpool on 5 October, Mané scored his 50th league goal for the club in a 2–1 win over Leicester City.[75]

On 21 October, Mané was named in the 30-man shortlist for the 2019 Ballon d'Or.[76] On 2 December he finished in fourth place for the award, behind Lionel Messi, Liverpool teammate Virgil van Dijk and Cristiano Ronaldo.[5] Two days later, he scored once and assisted two more goals as Liverpool beat Everton 5–2 in the Merseyside derby to extend their unbeaten run in league football to 32 matches, which was a new club record.[77] Later that month, Liverpool won the 2019 FIFA Club World Cup, with Mané setting up the winning goal scored by Firmino in the final against Flamengo.[78]

On 7 January 2020, Mané was named the CAF African Footballer of the Year.[8][79] He is only the second Senegalese after El Hadji Diouf to have won this award.[80]

On 24 February, Mané scored the winner in a 3–2 home win against West Ham United in the Premier League as Liverpool made it 21 consecutive home wins, a league record shared with Bill Shankly's Liverpool team from 1972, and also made it a joint Premier League record 18 wins in a row.[81][82] On 7 March, Mané scored the winning goal in a 2–1 win against Bournemouth at Anfield as Liverpool set a new English top-flight record of 22 consecutive home wins.[83] Liverpool went on to win the Premier League title at the end of the season.[84]

2020–21 season
On 20 September 2020, Mané opened his scoring account in the 2020–21 Premier League with both Liverpool goals in a 2–0 win away to Chelsea.[85] On 2 October 2020, Mané tested positive for COVID-19.[86] Given his and Liverpool's stuttering form, Mané stated that 2020–21 had been the worst season of his career.[87] On 23 May 2021, the final day of the League season, Mané scored a brace in a 2–0 win over Crystal Palace securing third-place for Liverpool and qualification for the next Champions League season.[88][89]

2021–22 season

Mané and Salah during a pre-season game in 2021
On 18 September 2021, Mané scored his 100th Liverpool goal in a 3–0 home win against Crystal Palace in the Premier League.[90] The goal against Crystal Palace also saw Mané set a new Premier League record by becoming the first player to score in nine consecutive league games against the same opponent.[90] On 16 October, Mané scored his 100th Premier League goal—becoming the third African to reach the landmark after Didier Drogba and Salah—with Liverpool's opening goal in the 5–0 win away to Watford.[91][92] On 10 April 2022, his 30th birthday, Mané scored Liverpool's equalising goal in a 2–2 away draw against Manchester City.[93] Mané then followed this with two goals against the same opposition on 16 April at Wembley Stadium in a FA Cup semi-final, in a 3–2 win to help Liverpool reach their first FA Cup Final since 2012.[94]
