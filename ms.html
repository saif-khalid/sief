2017–18: Record-breaking individual success

Salah playing for Liverpool in 2017. His performances in the 2017–18 season saw him receive numerous accolades, including PFA Players' Player of the Year and the Football Writers' Player of the Year.
On 22 June 2017, Salah agreed a transfer to Liverpool. He signed a long-term contract with the Reds for an initial £36.5m fee that could rise to £43m.[97] The fee was a club record, eclipsing the £35m spent on Andy Carroll in 2011.[98] He was assigned the number 11 shirt previously worn by Roberto Firmino who instead switched to number 9.[99] He joined the club on 1 July upon the opening of the summer transfer window, becoming Liverpool's first Egyptian player.[100] He scored on his Premier League debut against Watford in a 3–3 draw on 12 August.[101] On 24 August, Salah scored his second goal for Liverpool, in a 2017–18 UEFA Champions League play-off round 4–2 win (6–3 agg) against Hoffenheim, his first goal at Anfield.[102] Three days later, Salah scored and assisted a goal in a 4–0 victory over Arsenal.[103] For his performances in August, Salah was awarded Player of the Month by Liverpool supporters.[104] On 17 October, Salah netted twice in a 7–0 Champions League win over Maribor, helping Liverpool to the joint-largest ever away win in the competition, and the largest away win by an English club.[105]

On 26 November, Salah scored the opener and refused to celebrate in a 1–1 home draw with his former team Chelsea out of respect for the club as well as victims of the North Sinai Mosque attack two days earlier.[106] Salah rose the top of the Premier League goalscoring charts by scoring twice after coming on as a substitute away at Stoke City on 29 November in a 3–0 win.[107] The following month, Salah netted in a 4–0 win over AFC Bournemouth; a result which saw Liverpool become the first team in Premier League history to win four consecutive away league matches by a margin of at least three goals.[108] In the process, he also became the joint-second fastest player to reach 20 goals for Liverpool on his 26th appearance, behind George Allan who reached the milestone in 19 appearances in 1895.[109]

On 17 March 2018, Salah scored four goals in a 5–0 win over Watford, which was his first hat-trick for Liverpool. In this game, he also broke a record of scoring 36 times in his debut season for Liverpool, and also became the leading goalscorer in Europe's top five leagues – overtaking Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Tottenham striker Harry Kane. Following Salah's record-breaking goal exploits former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard stated "we are witnessing the start of greatness".[110]

In early April 2018, he scored in both Champions League quarter-final matches against Manchester City to help his side advance.[111] On 22 April 2018, Salah was awarded the PFA Players' Player of the Year award,[112] having earlier been named in the PFA Team of the Year for the Premier League.[113] Two days later, he scored a brace in a 5–2 Champions League semi-final first leg win over former club, Roma. In doing so, he simultaneously became the first player from Africa and the first Liverpool player to score 10 goals in a single campaign in the tournament. His double also took him to 43 goals for the season across all competitions, surpassing Roger Hunt's tally of 42, and making him Liverpool's second-highest goalscorer in a single season, behind Ian Rush.[114] He had previously also broken the club's record for the Premier League era, surpassing Robbie Fowler's total of 36 goals set in the 1995–96 campaign, and Fernando Torres' record of 33 for the most goals by a Liverpool player in a debut season.[115] After his two goals and assists in the first leg against Roma, Salah featured in the second leg as Liverpool beat Roma 7–6 on aggregate to qualify for the final for the first time in eleven years.[116] He would then become the Premier League's all-time goalscorer for a 38-game season, registering his 32nd league goal in a 4–0 win against Brighton & Hove Albion en route to being awarded the Premier League Golden Boot.[117]

In the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final against Real Madrid, Salah injured his left shoulder in the 30th minute.[118] After initially carrying on, he left the field in tears after going to ground in a challenge with Madrid defender Sergio Ramos;[119] the match ended in a 3–1 defeat. The Egyptian FA stated that this would have no effect on his playing at the 2018 World Cup in Russia and that Salah would still be named in the team's final squad on 4 June.[120] The day after the match, Ramos wrote a message and sent him good wishes.[121]
