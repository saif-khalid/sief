On 19 July 2018, Liverpool officially confirmed the signing of Alisson for a fee of £66.8 million (€72.5 million), making him the most expensive goalkeeper of all time, surpassing the transfers of Ederson (most expensive in pound sterling) and Gianluigi Buffon (most expensive in Euros).[4][29][30][31] However, the fee was broken just four weeks later when Chelsea signed Kepa Arrizabalaga for a reported £71.6 million (€80 million) from Athletic Bilbao.[32] On 10 August, Liverpool confirmed via their official website that he would wear the vacant number 13 shirt in the 2018–19 season.[33]

2018–19 season
Alisson made his official debut for Liverpool on 12 August, keeping a clean sheet in a 4–0 win over West Ham United.[34] He received praise for his subsequent performances in wins over Crystal Palace and Brighton which saw him keep three consecutive clean sheets.[35][36] In August, Alisson was shortlisted for UEFA Champions League Goalkeeper of the Season,[37] finishing in second place.[38] On 1 September, in a 2–1 win over Leicester City, he received both praise and criticism for his performance, making several vital saves but also contributing to the opposition's goal.[39][40] However, with Alisson in goal, Liverpool went on a run of 20 games unbeaten in the league from the start of the season which saw the Brazilian break Javier Mascherano's record for the longest-such streak.[41] Alisson also played an important role in Liverpool's Champions League group stage campaign, making a vital save late on in their final group game against Napoli as Liverpool won 1–0 to advance to the knockout stages.[42]

On 4 March 2019, he kept his 17th Premier League clean sheet for the season; the most by any Premier League goalkeeper in his debut season since former Liverpool goalkeeper, Pepe Reina in 2006.[43] At the end of the season, Alisson kept a total of 21 clean sheets in Premier League, and won the Golden Glove.[44] In the Champions League knockout stages, meanwhile, Alisson played a starring role as Liverpool advanced to their second consecutive final in the competition; in their second-leg semi-final at home to Barcelona, he made a number of impressive saves as Liverpool overturned a 3–0 first leg deficit to advance past their opponents with a 4–0 home win.[45] In the final on 1 June 2019, Alisson kept a clean sheet for Liverpool as they defeated Tottenham Hotspur 2–0, making eight saves in the process, to win his first trophy with the club.[8]

2019–20 season

Alisson with Liverpool in 2019
After spending his first season with the designated squad number 13, it was announced that Alisson would be wearing the number 1 shirt for the 2019–20 season, which had previously been worn by Loris Karius.[46]

Alisson started in the 2019 FA Community Shield against Manchester City on 4 August; after a 1–1 draw, Manchester City ultimately won the title 5–4 on penalties.[47] On 9 August 2019, in the opening match of the 2019–20 Premier League season against newly promoted Norwich at Anfield, Alisson picked up a calf injury in the first half, and had to be replaced by new signing Adrián after 38 minutes.[48] He was expected to be out injured for a "few weeks".[49] As a result, he was ruled out of the 2019 UEFA Super Cup,[50] which Liverpool won 5–4 on penalties on 14 August, following a 2–2 draw with Chelsea after extra-time.[51]

He returned to the matchday squad on 20 October, in a 1–1 draw with rivals Manchester United.[52] On 30 November, in a 2–1 win over Brighton, he was sent off for handling the ball outside his designated area.[53] On 21 December, Alisson kept a clean sheet against Flamengo in the 2019 FIFA Club World Cup Final with Liverpool winning the trophy for the first time.[9] On 19 January 2020, Alisson assisted Mohamed Salah's 93rd-minute goal, in a 2–0 home win against Manchester United in the league.[54]

On 6 March 2020, Alisson was injured again,[55] meaning he missed the next day's Premier League win against Bournemouth, and the UEFA Champions League Round of 16 Second Leg loss against Atletico Madrid, the final two Liverpool matches before the season was suspended due to the Coronavirus pandemic in the UK. He ended the 2019–20 Premier League with a Premier League Winner's medal, having made 29 appearances.[56]

2020–21 season
On 20 September 2020, Alisson saved a penalty in Liverpool's second league game of the 2020–21 Premier League season, a 2–0 away win over Chelsea;[57] this was Alisson's first penalty save for Liverpool since joining the club, and Jorginho's first missed penalty in nine attempts for Chelsea in all competitions.[58]

On 7 February 2021, Alisson made two errors in the space of three minutes, conceding possession to allow Manchester City's İlkay Gündoğan and Raheem Sterling to score, as Liverpool lost 4–1.[59]

On 16 May 2021, Alisson scored a dramatic late winner in a 2–1 victory against West Bromwich Albion. With Liverpool chasing a spot in the top four and the score tied at 1–1, Alisson came up for a Liverpool corner in the 95th minute. The corner, taken by Trent Alexander-Arnold, found Alisson, who managed to score with a header. This was the first goal scored by a keeper in a competitive match in Liverpool's 129-year history,[60] and Allison became the sixth goalkeeper to score in the Premier League.[61]
