<h3>ian graham</h3>
<p>A desire for change led Ian Graham to conclude that a life in academia wasn't for him.

The conventional career path open to a doctor in the field of theoretical physics - a title he’d earned by completing a PhD at the University of Cambridge in early 2005 - was not one he wanted to follow. 

“Originally, I thought I would be a scientist,” Graham tells Liverpoolfc.com. 

“After doing my PhD, I started a two-year post-doc - which is basically your first job if you’re going to stay in the university sector - in polymer physics at Cambridge. A desire for change led Ian Graham to conclude that a life in academia wasn't for him.

The conventional career path open to a doctor in the field of theoretical physics - a title he’d earned by completing a PhD at the University of Cambridge in early 2005 - was not one he wanted to follow. 

“Originally, I thought I would be a scientist,” Graham tells Liverpoolfc.com. 

“After doing my PhD, I started a two-year post-doc - which is basically your first job if you’re going to stay in the university sector - in polymer physics at Cambridge.

“I was a year into it but slowly came to the realisation that maybe that career wasn’t for me.”

A decade-and-a-half later, Graham is Liverpool FC’s director of research; the leader of a six-strong data analysis team that has a remit encompassing pre and post-match work, sports science, the Academy and, primarily, recruitment. 

His journey here began when an exciting alternative to his scientific pursuits presented itself through a combination of chance and fortune. 

“My girlfriend worked at the exam board in Cambridge at the time and the head statistician there sent around an email with a job advert to do football stats for a living,” Graham recalls.

“It was just luck really that she forwarded me that advert and I applied for it and got the job. It was a very sudden thing - the career didn’t really exist at the time in the same way that it does now, when if you graduate from uni with a numerate degree then you can get into the sports industry in various roles. 

“It wasn’t something I was looking to do, but when I saw the job advert I thought, ‘This would be a brilliant thing to try.’”
